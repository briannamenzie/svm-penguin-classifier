## **SVM Penguin Classifier**

- This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify penguin species based on their physical measurements. The dataset includes three species from the Palmer Penguins dataset: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
- The goal was to build and evaluate SVM models (both linear and kernel-based) to predict species from features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.

### **Notes**
- This was completed as a school assignment and is intended for personal learning. The code is not modular or production-ready—I’m just sharing my work.
