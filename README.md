## **🐧 SVM Penguin Classifier**
- This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify species of penguins from the Palmer Penguins dataset. The dataset contains three species — Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo — with four features: bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.

### **Key Features**
- Exploratory data analysis with scatter plots of feature pairs
- SVM classification using linear kernels
- Evaluation of model accuracy on both separable and non-separable feature pairs
- Full-dataset classification achieving ~99% accuracy
- Prediction of unknown penguin species

### **How to Use**
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells. The dataset is included in the repository, so no additional setup is required.

### **Notes**
- This project was completed as a course assignment. It is not modularized for reuse but is shared here to showcase the workflow and results.
